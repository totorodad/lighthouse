Setup steps:
1. Setup raspberry Pi with latest 64bit (bookworm).

2. Make Hostname: lighthouse
	sudo raspi-config
	System Options -> Hostname

3. Turn on SSH (useful for debugging later):
	In raspi-config choose Interface Options->SSH-enable
	Or add a blank file called: SSH to the bootfs partitioning

4. Turn on VNC
	In raspi-config choose Interface Options->VNC-enable
5. Reboot

6. Transfer the files below to your Pi using ftp/scp/gmail/ect.

7. Move/copy these files from git:
	/home/pi/.config/wayfire.init
	This file boots the python script that runs the on off timer
	/home/pi/lighthouse/boot.sh
	Make this executable: chmod +x boot.sh
	This is called by the wayfire.ini on boot up.

8. It will launch one instance of /var/www/html/lighthouse -timer
	Lighthouse -timer stays resident in memory and sets the lights all on and off based on the contents of /var/www/html/.startstop which is created by setting the time 
9. VNC into lighthouse.local

10. At command prompt install the following:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

11. Install Apache 2:
	sudo apt install apache2 -y

12. Give ownership to all files and folders in the /var/www/html directory to the www-data group:
	sudo usermod -a -G www-data pi
	sudo chown -R -f www-data:www-data /var/www/html

13. Install PHP:
	sudo apt install php -y

14. Download files from my github:
	In a directory like /home/pi/lighthouse for example
	git clone https://github.com/totorodad/lighthouse.git

15. Copy the files as needed:
	cp index.php izakaya.png lighthouse.py styles.css /var/www/html
	Make files bootable:
		chmod +x /home/pi/lighthouse/boot.sh
		chmod +x /var/www/html/lighthouse.py

16. Add the following two lines to the end of /home/pi/.config/wayfire.ini
	[autostart]
	Terminal = lxterminal -e $HOME/lighthouse/boot.sh

17. Give Apache (www-data) user the ability to run python as root without password:
	sudo -s
	nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
	Add this line to the bottom:
		www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3
	Note to user.  This may create a cybersecurity hole.  Use this technique on systems protected by firewall or other means.

18. Reboot
	Open web browser to lighthouse.local
	Turn lights on/off to verify the lighthouse.py python program is working.
	Set and test the timer.
